    <release version="5.0.2" date="2011-07-11"
             description="version 5.0.2 is an interim release of Orekit with support for IERS
             Rapid Data and Prediction files.">
      <action dev="luc" type="update">
        Added support for IERS Rapid Data and Prediction files finals.all, finals.data and finals.daily,

             description="version 5.0.1 is a minor release of Orekit without any functional changes.
             The differences with respect to 5.0 are only related to packaging and deployement to

      <action dev="luc" type="update">
        updated packaging to allow deployment to maven central.
      </action>
    </release>
    <release version="5.0" date="2010-05-06"
             description="version 5.0 is a major release of Orekit. It introduces several new
             features and bug fixes. Some slight incompatibilities with respect to previous
             versions have been introduced, but they should be easy to overcome to users. Users
             are strongly advised to upgrade to this version. The major points introduced in version
             5.0 are a very general PVCoordinatesProvider interface, a new shiftedBy method allowing
             many time-dependent instances (AbsoluteDate, Orbit, PVCoordinates, Attitude and SpacecraftState)
             to be slightly shifted in time using simple evolution models (keplerian for orbit, fixed
             angular rate for attitude, fixed translation for position/velocity), a redesign of the
             attitude interfaces and an experimental (read subject to change) numerical propagator
             able to compute jacobians of the state with respect to both initial state and force
             models parameters. Version 5.0 now depends on version 2.1 of Apache commons math.">
      <action dev="pascal" type="add">
        a new experimental numerical propagator has been added, in addition to computing
        the spacecraft state at target time, it also computes the partial derivatives of
        this state with respect to the initial state (one jacobian) and with respect to
        models parameters (another jacobian). The jacobians are integrated alongside with
        the state, using variational equations for better accuracy and numerical robustness.
        This will help further implementation of orbit determination or optimization
        algorithms. This code is still considered to be experimental as of 5.0 and the API
        could change in the future.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add">
        a new SpacecraftFrame class has been added, taking into account orbit and
        attitude thanks to an underlying propagator. This allows to see the spacecraft just
        as another known geometrical object automatically handled and connected to all
        other frames. For an instantaneous view, Transform instances can also be built
        directly by SpacecraftState instances.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add">
        frames can now be flagged as quasi-inertial or not; only quasi-inertial frames
        are suitable for defining orbits
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add">
        the Topocentric frame now provides a way to retrieve the body shape on which the
        frame is defined
      </action>
      <action dev="pascal" type="update">
        changed the way Veis 1950 frame is constructed.
        Now, its parent is the PEF frame with no EOP corrections applied.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="fix" due-to="John Pritchard">
        fixed a parameters inversion in Earth Orientation Parameters for IAU-1980 models.
        The error could introduce up to a few meters error in position during transformations
        between TEME and MEME
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add" >
        factories have been introduced for handling all data formats. Their default configuration
        correspond to the legacy formats used in previous versions (IERS format for UTC-TAI, EOPC04
        and bulletins B for Earth Orientation Parameters, JPL format for celestial bodies ...).
        Users can now add support for their own formats if they want (for example if they prefer
        using bulletins A instead of EOPC04 and bulletins B, or if they have their own gravity
        field format ...). Consequences of these changes are that the SolarSystemBody and
        the PotentialReaderFactory classes have been deprecated (replaced by CelestialBodyFactory and
        GravityFieldFactory) and that TimeScalesFactory and FramesFactory have been extended. All these
        factories follow the same generic pattern.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="fix" >
        improved thread safety (however, Orekit is still NOT completely thread-safe).
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add" >
        the loaders for gravity fields now can optionally allow missing coefficients (they will be
        replaced by 0.0 except c[0][0] which will be replaced by 1.0).
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="fix" >
        the loader for gravity fields in the ICGEM format now support empty lines in the file
        (there is for example one blank line at the end of the file in the orekit-data zip archive).
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add" >
        added support for the GRGS gravity field files formats.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add" >
        added a way to list the available satellite numbers in TLE files.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="update" >
        improved TLE elements loading. Now TLE lines are loaded using the standard data loading
        mechanism (thus allowing loading from disk files, network, classpath ...), they can
        contain TLE for several objects in one file, and they may contain some non-TLE lines
        if desired.
      </action>
      <action dev="v&#233;ronique" type="add" >
        a new PVCoordinatesProvider interface has been created on top of several existing classes
        and interfaces (orbit propagator, celestial bodies, some moving frames ...). This is a
        major generalization that allows to use either satellites or celestial bodies in many
        algorithms (attitude pointing target, eclipses and field of view events ...)
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="fix" >
        improved numerical propagator efficiency when used from an outside loop: the initial
        state is automatically set to the last state at propagation end, thus allowing to
        restart from here without recomputing everything
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add" >
        added a reset feature in all propagators, allowing to reuse an already configured
        propagator for several different orbits
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="fix" >
        fixed a mode handling error in NumericalPropagator: when a propagator was reused
        with a new mode setting, the previous step handlers were still used in addition to
        the new ones instead of replacing them
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="fix" >
        fixed an interpolation error for orbits crossing the -PI/+PI singularity between
        entries in the Ephemeris class
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="update" >
        KeplerianPropagator now preserve orbits types
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add" >
        AbsoluteDate, Orbit, PVCoordinates, Attitude and SpacecraftState instances can now all
        be slightly shifted in time using simple evolution models (keplerian for orbit, fixed
        angular rate for attitude, fixed translation for position/velocity). This is not a
        replacement for proper propagation but is useful for known simple motions or small
        time shifts or when coarse accuracy is sufficient
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="fix" >
        changed AttitudeLaw.getState signature to use complete orbit. This is an incompatible
        change introduced to fix a major bug in spin computation for some attitude laws. The laws
        for which orientation depends on satellite velocity have a spin vector that depends on
        acceleration. This can be computed only if complete orbit is available. This change
        should be simple to handle from a users point of view, as the caller generally already
        has the orbit available and attitude laws implementations can retrieve all the former
        parameters (date, position/velocity, frame) directly from orbit.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="fix" >
        fixed spin rate computation errors in almost all attitude modes
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add" >
        added a new simple linear attitude mode: FixedRate
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="fix" >
        fixed an error in event detection: when two events were very close (for example a very
        short ground station visibility), the second one may be ignored despite the first one
        was detected.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="fix" >
        fixed corner cases in event detection during orbit propagation, sometimes
        an already detected and handled event prevented the propagator to go further in time.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add" >
        added an EventShifter wrapper allowing to slightly shift raw events in time. This is useful
        for example to switch an attitude mode from solar pointing to something else a few minutes
        before eclipse entry and going back to solar pointing mode a few minutes after eclipse exit.
      </action>
      <action dev="pascal" type="add">
        added a new AlignmentDetector.
      </action>
      <action dev="pascal" type="add" >
        added a new EclipseDetector handling either umbra or penumbra entry and exit events.
      </action>
      <action dev="v&#233;ronique" type="add" >
        added new CircularFieldOfViewDetector and DihedralFieldOfViewDetector handling
        field of view entry and exit events for any type of target.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add" >
        added an experimental implementation of a BoxAndSolarArray spacecraft model considering a convex
        body (either parallelepipedic or defined by a set of facets) and a rotating solar array, for
        accurate modeling of surface forces with attitude. Beware that this class is still considered
        experimental, so use it with care!
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="update" >
        completely changed the RadiationSensitive and DragSensitive interfaces to be more comprehensive
        and handle properly lift and side force effects when used with non-symmetric spacecrafts/flux geometry
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="fix" due-to="Christelle Blandin">
        fixed denormalization of gravity field coefficients, the last coefficient
        was not initialized
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add" >
        added a relative constructor and a getMomentum method to PVCoordinates
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add">
        added a special implementation improving performances for the frequent case of identity transform
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="fix">
        fixed forgotten radians to degrees conversions for inclination and RAAN in CircularOrbit.toString()
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add">
        added a Constants interface including a few useful physical constants.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add">
        added a way to build date components from week components (this can be used
        for scheduled operations with week-related periods)
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add">
        added string parsing features for dates and times components supporting ISO-8601 formats
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add">
        Orekit is now packaged as an OSGi bundle
      </action>
      <action dev="pascal" type="add">
        added some pieces of an UML model for the library (available in the source distribution)
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="update" >
        updated error message localization to be more consistent with Java exception. Now getMessage
        returns a non-localized message and only getLocalizedMessage returns a message localized for
        the platform default locale. A new getMessage(Locale) method has also been added to
        retrieve the message in any desired locale, not only the platform default one. The messages
        are also built and translated only when needed, so if an exception is triggered and
        never displayed, the message will never be built.
      </action>
    </release>
    <release version="4.1" date="2009-08-18"
             description="version 4.1 is an upgrade bringing some new features and fixing a
             few bugs. The equinox-based frames family with IAU1980 precession-nutation
             models that are still used by many legacy systems are now supported. This
             simplifies interoperability with legacy systems and helps migrating from this
             old frames family to the new CIO-based ones that is supported by orekit since its
             first versions. The data loading mechanism used to retrieve IERS data (Earth
             Orientation Parameters, UTC-TAI history) and JPL ephemerides is now also used
             to retrieve gravity potential files. This mechanism has also been vastly improved
             to support new use cases (loading from disk, from classpath, from network delegating
             loading to an external library ...). Another change is the addition of the TDB
             time scale. Some minor incompatibilities have been introduced but they are easy
             to solve for users, the explanations are provided in detailed changes report.">
      <action dev="aude" type="add" >
        added TDB time scale
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="update" >
        the RadiationSensitive and DragForce interfaces now have an
        additional SpacecraftState parameter in all their get methods.
        This allows to implement models that take into account solar
        arrays rotation. Note that this changes breaks compatibility
        for users that did add their own implementations, but it is
        simple to deal with (simply add one parameter in the signature
        and ignore it) so its was considered acceptable.

      <action dev="luc" type="add" due-to="James Housden">
        added german localization for error messages
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="update">
        added a feature allowing all tests to clear the already built reference
        objects (frames, time scales, solar system bodies ...) between each tests,
        thus removing the need to launch tests in separate JVMS. This allows to
        launch all tests directly from eclipse, and this speeds up maven tests by
        a factor 4 at least

        Orekit supports the two different naming patterns for bulletins B provided by IERS
        on http://www.iers.org/ and http://hpiers.obspm.fr/eop-pc/.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="update" >
        the predefined times scales (TAI, UTC ...) are now built using a factory. The various
        XXXScale.getInstance() methods defined in each predefined time scales classes
        are still available, but have been deprecated and will be removed in the future,
        they are replaced by TimeScalesFactory.getXXX().
      </action>
      <action dev="pascal" type="update" >
        the Frame class was split into a FramesFactory class, dealing with the predefined
        reference frames, and a Frame class for the creation of new frames and the navigation
        through any frames tree. The Frame.getXXX() methods for the predefined reference
        frames are still available, but have been deprecated and will be removed in the future,
        they are replaced by FramesFactory.getXXX().
      </action>
      <action dev="pascal" type="add" >
        3 new predefined reference frames have been added in Orekit : MEME, TEME and PEF. They
        implement the classical paradigm of equinox-based transformations including the IAU-76
        precession model, the IAU-80 nutation model and the IAU-82 sidereal time model, with
        the capability to apply the nutation corrections provided by IERS through the EOP data
        files for better agreement with the IAU 2000 precession-nutation model.

        fixed a state reset error: orbital state changed by event detectors like
        ImpulseManeuver were overwritten by other event detectors
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="fix" >
        fixed stop date of analytical propagators (Keplerian and Eckstein-Heschler). They used to
        stop at the first event after target date when an event detector was set up, instead of
        stopping at the target date
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="fix" >
        the gravity coefficients for solar system bodies are now extracted from JPL files headers
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="update" >
        the eventOccurred method in EventDetector interface and its various implementations
        has an additional parameter specifying if the switching function increases or
        decreases at event time. This allows simpler events identification has many switching
        functions have two switches (start/end, raising/setting, entry/exit ...). Note that
        this changes breaks compatibility for users that did implement their own events, but
        it is simple to deal with (simply add one parameter in the signature and ignore it)
        so its was considered acceptable.

        tidal corrections are now available for ITRF and TIRF frames. Both frames are
        provided in two versions, the standard one with tidal corrections and a stripped
        down one without tidal corrections. A cache/interpolation mechanism is used to
        keep the computation cost of tidal correction to a minimum. With this mechanism,
        the penalty to use tidal correction is slightly above 20% in run time for a
        transformation between GCRF and ITRF. A raw implementation without this mechanism
        would lead to a 550% penalty, or even a 1100% penalty if TIRF and ITRF parts were
        computed independently.

        The GeodeticPoint constructor arguments has been reordered to reflect more
        traditional usage, latitude coming before longitude.

        The low accuracy Sun model based on Newcomb theory and the Moon model based
        on Brown theory have been withdrawn as they are superseded by the support of JPL
        DE 405 binary ephemerides files.

      <action dev="luc" type="update">
        The ThirdBody abstract class has been removed and its specific method
        getMu has been moved up into CelestialBody interface and
        renamed getGM.

      <action dev="luc" type="update">
        Improved external data configuration. The java property is now called
        orekit.data.path and is a colon or semicolon separated path containing
        directories or zip archives, themselves containing embedded directories
        or zip archives and data files. This allows easy roll-out of system-wide
        configuration data that individual users can override by prepending their
        own data trees in front of the path. This also allows simple configuration
        since many data files can be stored in easy to handle zip archives.

      <action dev="luc" type="update">
        Renamed the iers package into data, as it is not IERS specific anymore. Some
        classes where also moved out of the package and into the frame and time
        package and their visibility reduced to package only. This improves decoupling
        and reduces clutter on users by limiting the number of visible classes.

      <action dev="luc" type="update">
        The performance of IAU-2000 precession-nutation model computation has been
        tremendously improved, using a combined caching and interpolation approach. The
        simplified model (which was quite inaccurate in version 3.1) has therefore been
        removed as it was not needed anymore.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="update">
        The ITRF 2005 frame is now supported instead of the older ITRF 2000 frame. The
        Earth Orientation Parameters data handling classes have been updated to match
        this change and read the new file format provided by IERS.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="update">
        The J2000 frame has been renamed as EME2000 as this name seems to be more
        widely accepted and reduces confusion with the J2000.0 epoch. The
        Frame.getJ2000() method is still available, but has been deprecated
        and will be removed in the future.

      <action dev="luc" type="update">
        Renamed some classes for better understanding: ChunkedDate is now DateComponents,
        ChunkedTime is now TimeComponents, ChunksPair is now DateTimeComponents. The
        getChunks method from AbsoluteDate as also been renamed into getComponents accordingly.

        Added a method to retrieve a body-centered inertial frame to the
        CelestialBody interface. As a consequence, thirteen new frames are
        predefined: Sun, Moon, planets and barycenters provided by JPL binary
        ephemerides.

      <action dev="luc" type="add">
        Support for the JPL DE 405 and DE 406 binary ephemerides files has been added
        and a factory class SolarSystemBody uses these files to provide implementations
        of the CelestialBody interface for Sun, Moon, the eight solar system
        planets,the Pluto dwarf planet as well as the solar system barycenter and Earth-Moon
        barycenter points.

        A getCalls() method has been added to the NumericalPropagator class to count the
        number of calls to the differential equations computation method. This helps
        tuning the underlying integrator settings in order to improve performances.

        Added predefined leap seconds to allow proper turn-key use of the library
        even without an already configured environment. All known leap seconds at
        time of writing (2008) are predefined, from 1972-01-01 to 2009-01-01 (the
        last one has been announced in Bulletin C 36 on 2008-07-04 and is not yet
        present in the UTC-TAI.history published file)

        Improved user-friendliness of the AbsoluteDate class by adding several
        new constructors and methods for common cases. It is in particular now possible
        to use offsets within a time scale, for example to build a date given as a
        fractional number of days since a reference date in UTC, explicitly ignoring
        intermediate leap seconds.

      <action dev="luc" type="add">
        Improved the class handling date components: added a constructor to allow building
        from any reference epoch, not only J2000.0 (thus simplifying use of modified julian day),
        added getMJD() method, added several constants JULIAN_EPOCH, MODIFIED_JULIAN_EPOCH,
