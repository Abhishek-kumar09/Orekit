/**
 * This class handles yaw compensation attitude provider.

 * <p>
 * Yaw compensation is mainly used for Earth observation satellites. As a
 * satellites moves along its track, the image of ground points move on
 * the focal point of the optical sensor. This motion is a combination of
 * the satellite motion, but also on the Earth rotation and on the current
 * attitude (in particular if the pointing includes Roll or Pitch offset).
 * In order to reduce geometrical distortion, the yaw angle is changed a
 * little from the simple ground pointing attitude such that the apparent
 * motion of ground points is along a prescribed axis (orthogonal to the
 * optical sensors rows), taking into account all effects.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This attitude is implemented as a wrapper on top of an underlying ground
 * pointing law that defines the roll and pitch angles.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Instances of this class are guaranteed to be immutable.
